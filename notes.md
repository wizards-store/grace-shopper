Notes:

Consider updating the readme with instructions - like how to contribute, what libraries you used, other information for people who might want to get involved (instructions on how to run are important)


I like that you're using the ready for review column - and linking thme to github pull requests

Make sure that you're always updating "in progress" unless you're actually all on vacation

Liked: card titles - nice format and good links to github issues

Make sure you're adding bugs and things that are left unfixed (not just enhancements) to your github issues

Make sure you're actually adding a description with implementation details
