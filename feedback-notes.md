- Try using the issues
- Like the tiny commits and PRs
- Standardizing naming on issues / PRs
- Standardize commit message format, for example [this one](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages)
- Joshua, fix your email commit: https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git/
- Like that you've updated your README consider doing more of that
- Consistent indentation
- Use comments to clarify / structure code
- Decide how you're going to style, and if you're going with a frontend framework (e.g. react-bootstrap) integrate it sooner rather than later
- Tests: yay!
